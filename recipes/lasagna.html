    <h3>Recipe of lasagna</h3>
    <p>Most people refer to sliced or shredded raw cabbage coated with mayo- or vinegar-based dressing as coleslaw (or just slaw). It may also contain lemon juice, onions, shredded carrots, slivered almonds, and even fruit. None of these would stand with my grandmother, Gonnie. Gonnie always called her take on coleslaw "cabbage salad," and I believe that's because the dish is, well, cabbage.</p>
    <p>While her exact portions are lost to history, everyone who has tasted my take on this family classic agrees that it tastes just like Gonnie's. And that's the best compliment anyone could give me. But it's something you can adjust to your own taste as long as the ingredients remain the same. Otherwise, Gonnie's ghost will come after you!</p>
